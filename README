# ook-translator
Ook Translator is a Python tool that converts text between human language and the Librarian's “Ook”-based orangutan language from Terry Pratchett's Discworld.

Each letter in human text is mapped to a specific “Ook” sound group. Translation from human to orangutan has a direct mappings, but translation in the other direction is trickier as several “Ook” combinations can map to the same letter (like genetic codons mapping to amino acids).

To handle this, the translator generates all possible human words for each “Ook” sequence and compares them against an English dictionary (via [`wordfreq`](https://pypi.org/project/wordfreq/)) to identify real words.

## Mapping of human sounds to orangutan sound groups

| Human Letters | Ook Sound   |
|----------------|------------|
| A, O, U        | ok         |
| B, P           | ook        |
| C, S, Z        | okk        |
| D, T           | Ok         |
| E, I, Y        | oK         |
| F, V, W        | ookk       |
| G, K, Q, X     | OK         |
| H              | Ookk       |
| J              | oOkk       |
| L              | oOKk       |
| M, N           | OokK       |
| R              | oOkK       |

## Installation

## Usage

### Translate from human to orangutan

Uncomment the section at the end of the script which calls the human translation function, fill in the file path, and run the script.
```python
translate_human("<YOURFILE>.txt")
```

### Translate orangutan to human

Uncomment the section at the end of the script which calls the orangutan translation function, fill in the file path, and run the script.
```python
translate_orangutan("<YOURFILE>.txt")
```

Translated files are saved in the same directory as the input with `_translated.txt` appended to the filename.
